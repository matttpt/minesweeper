# Minesweeper

The React tutorial has you build a tic-tac-toe game, but minesweeper is
much more fun, so here it is!

## Instructions

Run `npm run build`. The finished files are in a new `build`
subdirectory. Deploy to the static web server of your choice.

If you make changes, you may want to check them with ESLint. Invoke
`npm run lint` for that.

Happy minesweeping!
